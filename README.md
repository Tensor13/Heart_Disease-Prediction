# Heart Disease Prediction
 This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation for predicting the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning models. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of supervised learning algorithms to build a predictive model.
 ## Project Overview
  Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early prediction can help in timely intervention and management. This notebook demonstrates how to leverage machine learning techniques to predict heart disease based on patient data such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, and other medical attributes.
 ## Features
  * ### Data Preprocessing:
     Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical features.
  * ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Visualizes correlations and distributions of key attributes.
